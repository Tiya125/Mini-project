Fake News Detection

ABSTRACT:

The news gives us information about current events. We generally gather information through
different media like word of mouth, newspapers, blogs, online news sites and many social sites
people use daily.
Online journalism now- a- days is being used to the fullest. Many people are depending on online
news sites or news spreading through social media. Taking this as the advantage many people
started creating their own blogs and websites to start writing news in their version. In this process,
many people started creating fake news which is believed by many people reading them.
Furthermore, many advertising agencies and some companies are creating fake news using halfright information, spicing it up with irrelevant issues and matter along with flashing images to
attract readers and make them believe in it. Many sectors are being involved ever since in creating
fake news to attain people’s attention.

Supermarkets or malls are using them to increase their sales, hospitals to increase the count of
patients, politicians using them to gather more number of followers and mostly every sector in one
or the other way are creating fake news to get benefitted. This is just one side of the coin, flipping
it to the other side, some people are creating fake news to get rid of some problems they are facing,
say their competitors or rivals like politicians creating one on the opposition parties or their
opponent. As of all this is happening, many people believe it blindly and are falsely accused while
most of them are easily benefitted.

Fake news in India has led to many problems through online social media where we have 200
million monthly active users as of February 2017. To get rid of all this, fake news should be
identified and removed. Awareness should be created among people on this issue and some strict
action should be taken on the ones who create fake news.
This project works on detecting fake news from real news and we will be able to know what to
believe and what not to.

Fake news is being shared and believed by many people in recent times, which makes it hard to rely on online news sites. 
This project is a framework that detects and classifies fake news messages from Twitter posts using Machine Learning algorithms  PassiveAggressive Classifier and Naive Bayes. 
The main focus of the project is to build a “TfidfVectorizer” on the dataset. The TfidfVectorizer converts a collection of raw documents into a matrix of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency(TF-IDF) features. 
We also implement pipeline which is set up with the fit/transform/predict functionality, so that we can fit the whole pipeline to the training data and transform to the test data without doing it individually every time. 
Here Naive Bayes is also used as it’s a simple probabilistic classifier which uses Bayes Theorem with strong independent assumptions
The result displays if the news is “Fake” or “Real”.
